# Grubbsy's Youtube Downloader App | Windows Only!
## This script uses windows only features. A version will be made to work better with other Operaing Systems soon.
This program is a simple python script to allow the users to download youtube files from youtube.
- You can specify it's directory or just do it from where the file is run.
- You can name the file before you download it. 
- You can also leave those 2 things blank and let it run on it's own, leaving the filename as the title of the video, and it saves to the folder/downloads of where this script is run.
- You can download the audio-only version of videos or the normal versions.
